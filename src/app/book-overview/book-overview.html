    <strong>Welcome to <span class="overview-highlight">Our BookNest</span> —a cozy digital home for every book in our house.</strong>
    Each room on the map above represents a real space in our home, and every bookshelf has been
    carefully numbered so you can always find exactly where a book lives. To locate a book,
    simply look up its room and shelf number. The shelves are counted clockwise, beginning from
    the front of the house—our “street side”—as shown on the map. With this simple system,
    exploring our collection becomes a gentle wander through our personal library. Enjoy your
    time in Our BookNest!
